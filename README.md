# XGBPR_circ
#XGBP_circ This tool is an plant circRNA-RBP prediction tool. We have developed a XGBoost based method to identify RBP binding sites on circRNA. Finally, our training model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset. We have developed it into a predictive tool. You can easily use our trained model to perform prediction tasks directly; Alternatively, you can use your own data to train a new model.
